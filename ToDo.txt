- Run Program.CS as is - you will have 3 threads try to increment the global variable globalCounter. 
    - Each will try to add 1_000_000
    - You would expect 3*1_000_000 would be 3_000_000
    - unfortuantely, you likely did not get that outcome  
    - (If you did, increase from 1_000_000 to 10_000_000 or to 100_000_000 and you WILL see the error)
    - TURN IN a copy of the error output (not equalling 3_000_000)
- Change the code so you still have 3 threads running at the same time, but you don't get an error:
    - METHOD 1:  LOCK an object
    - METHOD 2:  use an atomic operation like "addi"
        - C# Interlocked class for your int
